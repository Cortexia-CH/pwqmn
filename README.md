**PWQMN-Browser: An interactive analysis tool for surface water quality data sets**

[The Provincial (Stream) Water Quality Monitoring Network](https://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-stream-water-quality-monitoring-network) has published a rich data set of its monitoring data, including 2165 stations and 150 parameters. More information on the dataset can be found [here](https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=13826) 

The current tool allows to present this dataset in interactive scatter, time series, boxplots, etc. to better discover patterns and trends. 

PWQMN-Browser is written in python and uses the following two main libraries:
*[streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
*[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)

A prototype can be visisted on [http://18.222.39.57:8501](http://18.222.39.57:8501)
