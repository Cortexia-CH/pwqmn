PAR001	1	The Provincial (Stream) Water Quality Monitoring Network (PWQMN) measures water quality in rivers and streams across Ontario since 1964. This dataset provides stream water quality monitoring data for a number of parameters, including total and dissolved nutrients, metals, and chlorophyll. Spatial information for stream monitoring locations across Ontario is also available. The raw data for this dataset is available  as MSExcel or ESRI Shape files on the [Ontario.ca data catalog](https://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-stream-water-quality-monitoring-network). 
PAR002	1	The PWQMN-Browser allows visualizing the raw data as different interactive plots and tables to gain further insight into trends and patterns not deceptable from the original data tables. The original data has been slightly extended, as described in the manual.
